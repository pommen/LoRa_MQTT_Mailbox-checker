# LoRa_MQTT_Mailbox-checker
My version of a mailbox check using LoRa RFM95 module on a custom arduino pro mini with 18650battery. communicating with a ESP8266 


ISP pins on the board mounted on the mailbox is mirrored. If used, either burn boot loader before mounting the 328p. Or use dupoint wires to connect to the programmer.
